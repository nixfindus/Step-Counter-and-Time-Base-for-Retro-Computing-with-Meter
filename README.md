# Step-Counter-and-Time-Base-for-Retro-Computing-with-Meter
An 74 Series and Arduino based Step Counter and Time Base for Retro Computing with Meter

With this project I tried to build a step generator, a frequency generator connected to a measuring device for experiments with classical microprocessors like the Z80.

The idea for the step generator is a modification of the project by Ben Eater.
